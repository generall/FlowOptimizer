Optimization of transition matrix for multystate sequences


Solving multistate sequence optomization problem.


Given:

Number of sequences of states with weights. Example:

```
[A:0.5, B:0.3] -> [C:0.1, A:3.0] -> [B:1.0, C:0.5]

[A:0.3, B:0.6] -> [C:0.2, A:2.0] -> [B:0.4, C:0.7]
```

Output:

Matrix of transition weights
